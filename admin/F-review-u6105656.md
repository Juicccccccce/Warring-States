Review Comments:
1. In method getCovered: Correctly find the col and row relationship between origin cooridnate and rotation/translation (best feature)
2. In Piece.java:139 set the proper default information
3. In Piece.java:143 if-else condition correctly set all condition to return -1
4. For method getCovered implement, it looks all good (well-documented, appropiate decomposition, proper naming). Also, it set the proper information for
   input error(139). In general, it is quite good implement.
